    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 premade 9” pie crust (Graham Cracker Pie Crust)</li>
        <li>⅓ cup sugar</li>
        <li>2 tbs brown sugar</li>
        <li>1½  tsp. ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>¾ tsp. salt</li>
        <li>½ tsp. ground ginger</li>
        <li>½  tsp. ground cloves</li>
        <li>½  tsp. ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>2 large eggs plus 1 large egg yolk</li>
        <li>1 can pumpkin (not pumpkin pie filling)</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>2 tsp. vanilla extract </li>
        <li>Whipped cream (for serving)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 325° Fahrenheit</li>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, whisk together sugar, brown sugar, cinnamon, salt, ginger, cloves, and nutmeg</li>
        <li>Beat in the eggs and egg yolk</li>
        <li>Add in the pumpkin, heavy cream, and vanilla, and mix</li>
        <li>Pour the mixture into the pre-made pie crust</li>
        <li>Bake for 30-45 minutes. To test, give the pan a gentle shake, and if the filling is super wobbly, it needs more time. If it only gives a very small wobble, it is ready. The top will also be a bit darker when it is ready</li>
    </ol>
