    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These s'mores cookies are a bit messy, but they are one of the tastiest things you'll ever make. They are so easy and tasty. </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>10 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1/4 cup light brown sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt (none if using salted butter)</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1 chocolate bar</li>
        <li>5 graham crackers sheets (or as many as you want)</li>
        <li>1 cup chocolate chips (or as many as you want)</li>
        <li>1 cup mini-marshmallows (or as many as you want)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li> Melt the butter in the microwave in 30 second bursts</li>
        <li>Add both sugars cream together for 1-2 minutes. The mixture will be lighter and creamier</li>
        <li>Mix together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a separate bowl (or just on top of the wet ingredients for an easier cleanup)</li>
        <li>Add in all of the toppings to your heartâ€™s content and mix</li>
        <li>Form in to dough balls of any size, the bigger the better</li>
        <li>Place on a plate in the fridge for at least an hour, up to 3 days, but ideally overnight (or in the freezer for 30 minutes)</li>
        <li>Bake at 350 degrees for 7-9 minutes</li>
        <li>Take the cookies out and add a piece of chocolate on the top of each cookie</li>
        <li>Take out just as the edges are starting to get golden.</li>
        <li>Grub hard</li>
    </ol>
