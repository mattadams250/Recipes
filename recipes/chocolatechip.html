    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is the best chocolate chip cookie recipe that you'll ever use. They are so perfect and soft, with amazing taste.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>190g (14 tbsp) unsalted butter, at room temp</li>
        <li>130g (2/3 cup) granulated sugar</li>
        <li>130g (2/3 cup) packed light brown sugar</li>
        <li>80g (2 large) eggs</li>
        <li>330g (2 2/3 cups) AP flour</li>
        <li>4g (1 tsp) baking soda</li>
        <li> 6g (1 tsp) salt</li>
        <li>100g (2/3 cup) milk chocolate chunks </li>
        <li>100g (2/3 cup) dark chocolate chunks</li>
        <li>1.5 tsp cornstarch</li>
        <li>1 drizzle of honey</li>
        <li>1 tsp vanilla</li>      
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Leave the butter out for 2 hours to soften, or just cut into 1/8ths and microwave for 30 seconds to soften
        <li>In a large bowl, cream together the 14 tbsp butter, 2/3 cup brown sugar, and 2/3 cup cane sugar using a spatula. (just mix and make sure everything gets incorporated, the mixture will be light and creamy)
        <li>3. Add in a drizzle of honey and 1 tsp of vanilla extract and mix
        <li>Mix in 2 large eggs, one at a time
        <li> In a separate medium-large bowl: mix together the 2 2/3 cup AP flour, 1 tsp baking soda, 1.5 tsp cornstarch, and 1 tsp of salt using a whisk, fork, or whatever you have
        <li> Add the flour mixture to the wet ingredients, half at a time, and mix
        <li> Mix in the chocolate chips, half at a time so they will be evenly incorporated (measure with your heart)
        <li> Roll into balls, place on 2 plates with each ball close together, and place into the freezer.
        <li> Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit
        <li> Just before the oven is preheated, place the cookie dough balls onto a baking sheet with a silicon mat(if you don't have one that's fine too)
        <li> Bake for 10-12 minutes, take out when the edges begin to brown
        <li> Let set for about 5 minutes (if you can) so the cookie will solidify. Or just eat instantly, that's what I do
    </ol>
